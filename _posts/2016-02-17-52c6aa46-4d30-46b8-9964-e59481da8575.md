where, **मैं = I **

**NGO = Non Government Organization = Non Govern-Mind Organization**

So, each individual is an NGO, a Free organisation in himself. where individual interacts with the world around him/her, defined as Worldview

**The Worldview**

Everything around .me can be placed in a
simple worldview, where .me interacts with the world around, the environment,
the plants, the animals and the people, making our experience of .we

Everything is connected,therefore each
of our actions, impacts the world in the given frame of worldview. And vice-versa,
other's impact on the worldview, effects ours. The world we communicate with, makes our worldview.
